Code for comparing excess and COVID19 mortality in Europe (or rather countries with mortality and populations in Eurostat). The data tsv files are not uploaded as 
they would be too large. The R code works with the downloaded tsv files from the demo_r_mweek3 mortality dataset and the population demo_r_pjangrp3 dataset.
The data files need to be in the code's directory. Code works with both regions and countries.

Please look into the file zzz_USER_SET_VARIABLES.R to see what things need to be set, especially the names of the downloaded tsv files. In the file RegionSetups.R 
you create a list where you specify what countries/regions to analyze. Then, in zzz_USER_SET_VARIABLES.R you provide the name of that list.
